###  Install the Resource

After you have installed a database, you will have to add the resource to the server. To do this, first
[download](https://github.com/GHMatti/ghmattimysql/releases) the `ghmattimysql.zip`
then extract the contents to the `/resources/` folder of your server configuration.

You are done with adding the resource to your server, click on *Next* to proceed with configuring the
resource and the FXServer for the connection.
